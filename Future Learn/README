The project focus is on the analysis of some interesting questions that are formed using the future learn 
user data set as the base. The main motive behind these analyses is to find a problem that is displayed in 
the data and provide results to those complications or highlight an opportunity that can be used to increase 
the number of users. <br>

# Points To Follow: 

* You will need `R-Studios` to run the analysis code and the project report. 

* To load the project template, you'll first need to `setwd()` into the directory where this README file is located. 


* Once that's done, you can execute any code you'd like. For every analysis
  I have created a seperate R file which cna be found in the `src` directory
  
* Before running the code you need to make some changes mentioned below:

	`setwd('C:/Users/Avi/Documents/Courses/CSC8631 - Data Management & Exploratory Data Analysis/Assginment/Project Template/src')`
	 You need to change this path with yours where you have downlaoded the project template. This needs to be done for all the .R files
	 stored in the `src` folder
	 
* To run the `.rmd` file you need to go in the `reports` folder where you have to press the `knit` which can be found in the top tool ribbon. 

* You will also need to install the following libraries by using `install.packages` in R.
	1. ggplot2
	2. dplyr
	
* The dataset for this project is stored in the `data` folder of the project template.
